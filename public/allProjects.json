        "description":"The X3CATOR SAR robot was designed to conduct early reconnaissance Search and Rescue (SAR) missions at locations of high-risk exposure to radiation or hazardous gases. The Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department (JBPM) have developed an innovative robot intended to conduct early reconnaissance Search and Rescue (SAR) mission at the location of high-risk exposure to radiation or hazardous gases. Developed by the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO) UTM and the Hazardous Material Unit Team (HAZMAT) of JBPM, The X3CATOR is a semi-autonomous tracked mobile robot platform. It is a specialized and versatile robot system which is designed to operate in challenging environments for search and rescue missions. The system consists of a tracked mobile robot and a dedicated Operator Control Unit (OCU) for remote operation and monitoring. With advanced environmental perception and mobility capabilities, the X3CATOR is specifically engineered to navigate through difficult terrains and debris-filled environments encountered during search and rescue operations. It is equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, including 3D Lidar, IMU, RGB-D cameras, and front and back cameras, allowing it to gather real-time information about the surrounding environment. The collected data is processed and used to create a 3D map, enabling the robot to identify potential rescue targets and obstacles accurately.

        "description":"Visual inspection in confined space is vital for keeping critical industrial infrastructure facilities to be continuously up and running. Confined space inspection stands for hard to reach and closed or partially closed environment. Confined space is usually GPS denied means lack of GPS signal. The majority of industries, including oil and gas, mining, construction, marine, chemical, indoor infrastructure, and waste-water treatment, conduct inspections of this kind.  IKAROS is an indoor confined space inspection aerial robot which aims to inspect critical confined indoor structures. IKAROS is designed to perform semi-autonomous inspection which makes it apart from conventional aerial inspection robots. It is equipped with on board sensing and computing capabilities to fly autonomously in confined space. The robot has 4 high power brushless motors for the propulsion system. It carries depth stereo cameras for create accurate real-time 3D mapping of the confined space. For doing the heavy computations of mapping and inspection assessment IKAROS equipped with onboard computer. The operator can give high level mission commands and record real-time live video and do mapping semi autonomously. The robot can be controlled from a portable control box that comes with the robot.  The IKAROS is possible to scaled up and replicated in other countries without any modification of the hardware. Due to compact size of the IKAROS it can be operated in most of the confined structure inspections. The inspection process can be made super easy with IKAROS which can save both time and cost which is the main need for critical confined space inspection applications. Therefore, IKAROS can be a good fit for inspection industries across the globe. As the market value is seen viable, it is hoped with this support, it will be able to bring this proposal to real commercialization towards its impact to society.",

The system showcased exceptional results, achieving a remarkable increase in docking accuracy and precision, with a margin of error as low as +- 10 cm. Moreover, to enhance the localization accuracy of the AMR, I successfully integrated data from the IMU and monocular vision camera. This fusion of information significantly reduced errors in position estimation and orientation, leading to improved overall performance. As a testament to the system's capabilities, I had the opportunity to demonstrate the Vision Guided Charging Dock in front of the West of England Mayor, Tory Tim Bowles, garnering positive feedback and appreciation for the cutting-edge technology.",

        "description":"Portable UVC Disinfection Robot is a robot that aims to disinfect a room using ultraviolet radiation (UVR). A short-wave, germicidal hard ultraviolet ray, Ultraviolet C (UVC) with a wavelength of 254 nm has been used to disrupt the DNA of any organisms in contact with UVC rays, therefore leaving them unable to carry out vital cellular functions. This method is called ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). UVC robot aims to be deployed in the hospital ward to fight against the highly contagious virus, COVID-19. The working concept of UVC robot is to emit UVC rays in a room continuously. Safety precautions have to be taken such as evacuate every person and confirm that there is no human inside the room before the UVC robot starts to operate. The UVC robot is designed by integrating a 2D laser range scanner to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to autonomously navigate and remotely operated the system. The web app can be used to operate the robot to navigate autonomously in the environment as well as to switch on and off the UVC light system to start the disinfection process. Features of delay start and timer mode will be included as it is essential for UVC disinfection process. Start time delay and period of disinfection can be set by the operator depending on the room size and desired disinfection factor. The microbial count will be used to determine the cleanliness of the disinfected room.",

        "description":"Last-mile delivery distribution is the greatest obstacle faced by logistics firms in the entire process of shipping goods to customers. Damaged goods, unsuccessful distribution, and elevated traffic congestion are one of the concerns facing last-mile delivery. Last-mile delivery is both costly and challenging, and it can also damage the impression of the buyer of the entire shopping experience. Many businesses have turned to the use of delivery robots for delivery purposes with the ever-growing complexities of last-mile delivery. Robots are being designed, for example, to carry anything from food orders to packages. Because of the following advantages, the transformation of logistics towards the use of delivery robots is gaining attention. While I was working as a master trainer in a robotics training program at Polytechnic Sultan Azlan Shah (PSAS) Institute, I was involved in the development of last-mile parcel delivery robot. We have transformed an electric cart to an autonomous delivery robot. We have integrated wide variety of sensor like 3D lidar, RTK GPS, Stereo-Camera, Radar, IMU, and so on. For the main onboard computation Intel NUC was used. The crucial part of the development was navigation planning, we have implemented RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping) using 16 channel 3D Lidar. Moreover, stereo and monocular vision will be used for lane tracking and pedestrian detection. Currently, we are working to integrate the global map of the planner with google map for point to point navigation. The development of this project is ongoing.",
